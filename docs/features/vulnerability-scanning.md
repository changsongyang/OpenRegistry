# Vulnerability Scanning for Container Images  

This feature allows the user to scan a container image for any known vulnerabilities. Which means if there's a 
vulnerable package or binary in a container image,  users will have the option to remediate that by upgrading to a newer 
version or change the base layer of the container image.

## Github Pull Requests:

- Backend - [PR #524](https://github.com/containerish/OpenRegistry/pull/524)
- Frotend - [PR #140](https://github.com/containerish/openregistry-web/pull/140)

## How to test this feature:

All of the repositories have this feature available in their settings page. 
Web path - `Repository -> Settings -> Generate Vulnerability Report`.
A repository lives under a path like this: `https://app.openregistry.dev/u/<username>/<repository>`, 
eg. for a user with the username of **johndoe**, and a repository named **ubuntu**,  
will have a perma-link available at the path of `https://app.openregistry.dev/u/johndoe/ubuntu`
